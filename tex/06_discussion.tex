\section{Discussion}

study of correlation between neg. log likelihood and MSE to known parameters could be interesting to evaluate just how good of a measure likelihood is to choose the best model.

Ensemble: shows good correlation with true parameters but worse than best model. One could consider dropping models from the ensemble which likelihood scores were poor compared to the rest.
